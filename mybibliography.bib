    abstract = {In mathematics, there are several equivalent ways of defining the real numbers. One of them is that they form a complete ordered field that does not contain any smaller complete ordered field. Such a definition does not prove that such a complete ordered field exists, and the existence proof consists of constructing a mathematical structure that satisfies the definition.
    The article presents several such constructions. They are equivalent in the sense that, given the result of any two such constructions, there is a unique isomorphism of ordered field between them. This results from the above definition and is independent of particular constructions. These isomorphisms allow identifying the results of the constructions, and, in practice, to forget which construction has been chosen.},

    abstract = {Introducing foundational concepts in infinite-dimensional differential geometry beyond Banach manifolds, this text is based on Bastiani calculus. It focuses on two main areas of infinite-dimensional geometry: infinite-dimensional Lie groups and weak Riemannian geometry, exploring their connections to manifolds of (smooth) mappings. Topics covered include diffeomorphism groups, loop groups and Riemannian metrics for shape analysis. Numerous examples highlight both surprising connections between finite- and infinite-dimensional geometry, and challenges occurring solely in infinite dimensions. The geometric techniques developed are then showcased in modern applications of geometry such as geometric hydrodynamics, higher geometry in the guise of Lie groupoids, and rough path theory. With plentiful exercises, some with solutions, and worked examples, this will be indispensable for graduate students and researchers working at the intersection of functional analysis, non-linear differential equations and differential geometry. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.},
